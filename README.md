# NEVToken

## Intro

NEVToken defines a design pattern for tokens created with investment purposes, where the token is not considered a standalone structure, but the center point of a set of unlimited Smart Contracts defining its value. Logic behind the token (and its value) is considered in different pieces using its basic functions and can be proposed to be changed by anyone, creating a new child upgrade. 

Token holders can then decide to upgrade to any new functionality, by moving its tokens to the new upgrade proposal.




## Specification


Investment tokens are mainly based on three different mechanisms:

- Aggregation of different tokens (constituying a portfolio).
- Supply creation and destruction of the token and the rest of its assets under management (AUM).
- Market rules (Buy/Sell mechanisms) regarding its AUM.
