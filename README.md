# NEVToken

## Intro

NEVToken aims to create a new pattern in token design, where variables regarding the token economy are modular and can evolve by unlimited forks.

NEV Tokens only define functionallities to modify supply and upgrade mechanisms. Any smart contract variable or functionallity needed to modify the value of the token (via usage of this functions) is substituted by ENS subnodes, being the token the registered master node.

Given that every token holder has agreed with the state of the contract in which he proceed to buy, any addition or change in the current state of the token should be optional for him. Thus, a child fork is created from this token, so he can decide to move his stakes and upgrade, or stay.
